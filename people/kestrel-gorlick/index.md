abstract: "I am a high school student at BASIS Flagstaff. My scholastic interests are focused mainly on computer science and general programming. I've programmed in Python for 3 years, and plan to learn Java and take the AP Computer Science AB next year. I plan on enrolling at NAU and majoring in computer science to get my bachelors degree. Hopefully after that, I will be able to enroll at MIT for my masters. Currently I am undertaking an independent study in the Caporaso Lab with an emphasis on [scikit-bio](http://www.scikit-bio.org)."
